**_Note:_** you can find the codebase from this blog post in this [Github repo](https://github.com/grahamplata/PrometheusSandbox).

> In the subsequent post I detail my thoughts and findings exploring [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) as effort to better understand monitoring in a container based world

## My Objectives

- Learn something! ~ Exercising my brain on something new!
- Get a better grasp of monitoring in a containerized world.
- Create and extendable playground to practice on.
