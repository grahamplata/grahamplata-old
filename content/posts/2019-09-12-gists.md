## Resize EC2 Root

- Power down services
  - Disable anything that has a + or is listed as start/running with the appropriate commands.
  - Obviously environements will differ
  - ```bash
    #Check services and shutdown any needed
    sudo service --status-all
    ```
- Create a snapshot of the EBS volume you need to resize.
- Create the new volume with the id of the snapshot you created in the previous step.
  - Make sure to create the new volume in the same datacenter.
- Attach new EBS Volume
  - Detach the old volume and attach the new volume to the root filesystem `/dev/sda1`
  - After you do this you will need to go to the Elastic IP tab and reattach the EIP to the EC2 instance.
  - Once everything is reattached you are good to restart the EC2 instance.
- Resizing

  - Restart and reconnect to the EC2 instance
  - Run `sudo df -h`

  - ```bash
    graham@node:~$ sudo df -h
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sda1        15G  9.5G  4.0G  71% /
    ```

  - Run `resize2fs /dev/sda1`
  - Re-Run `sudo df -h`

  - ```bash
    graham@node:~$ sudo df -h
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sda1        30G  9.5G  20.5G  31% /
    ```

    - After this youâ€™re good to restart services and start your application.
