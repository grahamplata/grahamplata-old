Inspired by the likes of [Dustin Klien](http://dustinklein.com/) and my good friend [Adam Tran](https://instagram.com/aviettran/) I decided it was time to embark on locating my next bike.

Living in Phoenixville has been pivotal in sparking my interest in cycling. Phoenixville is not only a fantastic hub for food and beverage enthusiasts but for cyclists as well. Phoenixville is nestled amongst the Perkiomen River Trail, Valley Forge and Schuylkill Trail. It is common to find the coffee shops and bars littered with cyclists taking breaks from the trail systems.

Last year I purchased a hybrid bike from the Twisted Cog, a local bike shop. It was a perfect suiter for everything in the area. As the months went by I could feel myself improving and soon I felt I needed something more.
