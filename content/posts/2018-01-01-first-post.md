Whenever I want to learn something new I always try to tie it into a project. I stumbled on gatsbyJS while doing research on React portfolios. For the past few months, I had been deep into React development and gatsby dovetailed right into my workflow.

Fast forward... This site was built with Gatsby and I hope that it is enough of a motivating factor (now that I rebuilt the site) to actually make interesting posts.
