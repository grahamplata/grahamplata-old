    <h3>What are you known for?</h3>
    <p>
      Graham's accumulation of talents was cultivated through curiosity,
      physical experience, and pure gut instinct. These factors create results
      that are often non-representational of a normal problem-solving method.
      Graham loves keeping his hands busy with as many different mediums as
      possible... often too many. Ranging from photography to programming and
      even distilling honey wine. Throughout his professional career, Graham has
      intermixed many disciplines of his past to inform and influence his future
      endeavors.
