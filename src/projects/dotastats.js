          A score Card that displays a short synopsis of a player's overall

          openDota Project.

          Inspired by the OpenDota Web UI I created a simple scored card for
          viewing Dota 2 data. This utilizes the OpenDota API, which is also an
          open source project. The purpose was to strengthen my react skills and
          learn a bit of redux along the way. The app provides a bite-sized view
          of players recent dota stats.{" "}

          Dota is a multiplayer video game in which two teams of five players
          compete to collectively destroy a large structure defended by the
          opposing team known as the "Ancient", whilst defending their own.

          This game united my friend group through our formative years. I was
          first introduced to the game during a weekend LAN party I had with
          friends. At the time Dota had many shortcomings, this was the time of
          private lobbies, frequent disconnects, and constant map downloads.
          Even with all its hard edges, it united our friend group into one
          focused effort. I can attribute Dota for keeping my friend group
          together when we departed for college. 10 years later we are still
          going strong. It's amazing how far the game has come.
