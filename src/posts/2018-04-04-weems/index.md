Weems? ...Where is that? Well Weems is adjacent to the Corrotoman and Rappahannock Rivers at the southern tip of the Northern Neck of Virginia. The area was know for its steamships and its image of small town America. Today, Weems is a small family town at the tip of the Northern Neck peninsula. It carries with it a sense of years gone by - preserving centuries of memories for generations to come.
