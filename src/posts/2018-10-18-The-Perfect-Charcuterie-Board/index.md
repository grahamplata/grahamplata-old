# Sabrina's birthday night at Teresa's Next Door Restaurant.

> A photo of what Sabrina and Graham deemed to be the most perfect cheese board.

Graham and Sabrina trusted their server for the night to relay to the chef at Teresa's Next Door to pick out three cheeses and two meats for their charcuterie board. The cheeses were a firm, semi-soft, and a blue soft cheese. The two meats were a spicy hot salami and prosciutto. The board was paired with crustini bread and a strawberry ganache.
